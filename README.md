# TIC TAC TOE
Tic-tac-toe is a simple, two-player game that, if played optimally by both players, will always result in a tie. The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os.
Tic-tac-toe is a game that is traditionally played by being drawn on paper, and it can be played on a computer or on a variety of media.

GAMEPLAY
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend (or the computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
